# Bond project has ended

As of March 2025, the Bond open-source project has ended.

* There will be no further activity in this project: no new features, no bug
  fixes, and, importantly, no security fixes.
* The Bond repositories on GitHub will remain, but they will be archived and
  read-only. You will still be able to access releases and source code, but
  you will no longer be able to open PRs or report issues.
* Bond's NuGet packages will remain on NuGet.org, but they will be unlisted
  and marked as unsupported.
* We will no longer monitor the StackOverflow tag "bond".
* The bond package on Hackage will be deprecated.

If you are a Microsoft team that uses Bond, please see https://aka.ms/bond
for Microsoft-internal guidance.

The Bond team at Microsoft would like to thank the Bond open-source
community for its support and collaboration these past ten years!

See the [old README](README.old.md) for details about how to build and use
Bond.

The most comprehensive documentation of the Bond binary formats can be found
in the files
[compact_binary.h](https://github.com/microsoft/bond/blob/master/cpp/inc/bond/protocol/compact_binary.h),
[fast_binary.h](https://github.com/microsoft/bond/blob/master/cpp/inc/bond/protocol/fast_binary.h),
and
[simple_binary.h](https://github.com/microsoft/bond/blob/master/cpp/inc/bond/protocol/simple_binary.h).

Microsoft has no affiliation with other open-source implementations of Bond.
We cannot endorse any of them, and Microsoft will not provide any support.

This announcement does not affect Microsoft products that themselves use
Bond. You can receive support for those products under their individual
support policies. However, these products will not provide general support
for Bond.
